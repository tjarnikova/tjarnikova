- 👋 Hi, I’m Tereza Jarníková. I'm an oceanographer currently using numerical modelling to understand the progression of ocean acidification in coastal environments. 
- 📍 I'm finishing my doctorate in the Mesoscale Ocean and Atmospheric Dynamics Group at the University of British Columbia.
- 📍 During my doctorate, I developed a carbonate chemistry model for the Salish Sea and used it to look at how much carbon the ocean has taken up since the pre-industrial era. 
- 📍 I'm also interested in using data science techniques to see what big model-generated datasets can tell us: https://os.copernicus.org/preprints/os-2021-66/
- 👀 My friend Kit and I once had fun with a data-postcard correspondence project, based on the Dear Data project: https://www.evaporatedkid.com/deardata
- 🌱 Sometimes I take photos and very rarely put them on my photo-and-creations website, www.evaporatedkid.com 
- I use she/her or they/them pronouns
- 🧸 Once I got followed by a bear on a cycle-access climbing trip in the North Cascades, which was not actually that dramatic but was quite memorable: https://www.ubc-voc.com/2019/09/03/carbon-neutraler-climbing-the-north-cascades-on-two-wheels-featuring-mutually-surprised-mammals-and-a-mediocre-decision
