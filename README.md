- 👋 🦭 Hi, I’m Tereza Jarníková. I'm an oceanographer currently using numerical modelling to understand carbon cycling in the Southern Ocean in the Green Ocean Modelling Group headed by Dr. Corinne Le Quéré at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in Norwich, England.
- 📍 I'm finishing my doctorate in the Mesoscale Ocean and Atmospheric Dynamics Group at the University of British Columbia. During my doctorate, I developed a carbonate chemistry model for the Salish Sea and used it to look at how much carbon the ocean has taken up since the pre-industrial era.  
- 📍 I'm also interested in using data science techniques to see what big model-generated datasets can tell us: https://os.copernicus.org/preprints/os-2021-66/
- 🇺🇦 As a Central European and as a person, I am extremely angry about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. To that end I am supporting legal counsel for Russian dissidents protesting their fascist government (OVD-info), and I invite you to join me: https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/ovd-info/
- 🚲 In my spare time, I like bikes, mountains, naps, surfing, and making lasagna. 
- 👀 My friend Kit and I once had fun with a data-postcard correspondence project, based on the Dear Data project: https://www.evaporatedkid.com/deardata
- 🌱 Sometimes I take photos and very rarely put them on my photo-and-creations website, www.evaporatedkid.com 
- I use she/her or they/them pronouns
- 🧸 Once I got followed by a bear on a cycle-access climbing trip in the North Cascades, which was not actually that dramatic but was quite memorable: https://www.ubc-voc.com/2019/09/03/carbon-neutraler-climbing-the-north-cascades-on-two-wheels-featuring-mutually-surprised-mammals-and-a-mediocre-decision
