- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tereza JarnÃ­kovÃ¡. I'm an oceanographer currently using submesoscale models to understand the progression of ocean acidification in the Salish Sea. I'm finishing my doctorate in the Mesoscale Ocean and Atmospheric Dynamics Group at the University of British Columbia. 
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested broadly in better understanding climate change and what we can do about it.
- ğŸ‘€ Because those are heavy topics, I'm also interested in bikes, naps, surfing, analog photography and beautiful data projects
- ğŸŒ± Sometimes I take photos and very rarely put them on my photo-and-creations website, www.evaporatedkid.com 
- ğŸ“« You can always email me at tjarnik [a] gmail [dot] com
